**MVC for PHP**

[Discussion of alternatives on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/108699/good-php-orm-library)

Distinctions in termininology between MVC & MVVM is important because viewmodels and models denote different things. Terminology of the domain entities (POCO) and the control/interaction layer is confusing.


_POCO Entities_

* ViewModel in MVC
* Model in MVVM

_Interaction & State_

* Controller/Model in MVC
* ViewModel in MVVM

_UI_

* View in MVC
* View in MVVM

**Whoops**

* Tweet stream returns unrelated tweets when filters yield few results
