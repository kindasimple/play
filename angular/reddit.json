This includes but is not limited to: usernames, page names, faces, **profile pictures**, location data of any kind, and first and/or last names. Failure to do so in a submission or a comment will result in a removal.\n \n* Do not post direct links to profiles, threads, or off-site material containing personal info. You will be banned and reported to the admins for this infraction.\n \n* **Do not ask for personal information of any kind nor for links to the facepalm sources.**\n \n* When removing personal information, completely cover them with opaque/solid color. Do not blur, \"pixelate\", or partially cover them.\n \n* **Witch hunts will not be tolerated.**\n \n* Racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, or otherwise abusive content will be removed and the commenter/poster may be banned. Please be civil, and **use [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) as a guideline.**\n \n* The mods reserve the right to remove posts subjectively deemed \"not a facepalm.\" For example, obvious jokes and sarcasm are not facepalms.\n \n* **Do not post misused memes or posts asking for likes/shares/comments  -- also known as \"like/share/comment whoring\"**\n \n* Do not post overused facepalms like \"l33t speak\", \"excessive slang usage\", \"internet speak\", \"my phone stopped working -- *sent from my mobile device*\", nor the alike;\n \n* **Grammar/spelling errors are not facepalms.** Do not make posts centered on grammar/spelling errors. (But if a grammar/spelling error leads to a facepalm-y situation/pun, you may post them.)\n \n* No posts featuring age. We get it. Kids are naive, elders have trouble with computers; it got old after the first thousand times of hearing about it, and bullying kids and elders is *never* acceptable here.\n \n**Things that *will* get you banned:**\n\n* Spamming\n* Doxxing of any kind\n* Racial Slurs\n* In some cases, user abuse\n* Breaking the rules stated above\n* Giving out any personal information\n\n**If you do get banned:**\n\n* Send a *polite* modmail asking for specifics about your ban. It might be temporary, in which case you should take it as a learning experience and review our rules.\n\n****\n\n\n#Subreddit Advertising:\n* /r/thisisawasteoftime ***NEW***\n* /r/NoX\n* /r/xkcdcomic  \n* /r/awwducational\n* /r/ImaginaryBattlefields\n* /r/ImaginaryCityscapes\n* /r/ImaginaryDemons\n* /r/ImaginaryVehicles\n* /r/ImaginaryWeaponry\n* /r/NatureGifs \n* /r/sloths\n* /r/conspiratard\n* /r/animalsbeingderps\n* /r/PlagiarizeMe\n* /r/EverydayArt ***NEW***\n* /r/versus",
